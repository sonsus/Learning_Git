for local:
git reset HEAD~1 --> set local head into just-beforehand state, leaving its history
git revert HEAD 
--> for remote branch. do exactly reverse functioning of the before and commit.
--> in this way you can easily "revert" mistakes without messing around fast-forward style


git add .
git add -A
git add -u

git commit -m " message I want "

git show HEAD
git diff
git checkout HEAD filename.txt                (discard the last vesi)

git reset HEAD filename.txt                   (un-add the file that is mistakenly added to the stage)
